## SILENCE PROJECT


# Description

Silence is an application that allows two users to connect and send each other encrypted SMS / MMS.
When an SMS is sent, the operator knows who sent the message, to whom it was sent and the time of sending.
Silence does not allow a confidential discussion with a person so that one can never know that these two users have been in contact. 
However, the messages do not use internet so no other actor is involved in the exchange. Only the operator can provide the SMS sent. 
Silence is currently the only way to send encrypted messages without an internet connection.
